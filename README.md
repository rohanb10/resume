# Personal website

I redesigned the site from scratch over a week in the summer of 2016. It has a much cleaner UI, is compatible with a greater number of browsers and is much quicker than before.

In addition to this, I worked hard on getting the page load very low.  I managed to get the entire first load of the page comfortably under 1mb. I resized all my assets to have a much smaller footprint, while still retaining their original quality.
