Update - 12/05/2016

I'm currently rewriting the site from scratch. You can view my progress at rohan.xyz/2/ and view the source code in the /2 folder

For the new site, I am using a custom build of bootstrap with only the responsive grid, and no other components/js. Other than jQuery and jQuery UI (js only), I am using no other packages.
