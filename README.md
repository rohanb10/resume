Written in vanilla JS (**without** jQuery)

**Why would I do something so dumb, yet so brave?**
I was writing most of this code completely offline and didn't really have the bandwidth to keep looking up the jquery docs. Some would call it lazy, not me.


The only 3rd party code I'm using is one [small polyfill](https://github.com/iamdustan/smoothscroll) because the boys over at Apple are [too uptight](https://caniuse.com/#search=scrollintoview) to allow parameter options for [`scrollIntoView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView)
