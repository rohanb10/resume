Written in native javascript (**without** jQuery)

**Why would I do something so dumb, yet so brave?**
I was writing most of this code connected to some pretty poopy internet so I didnt really have the ~~patience~~ bandwidth to keep looking up the jquery docs. Vanilla is my favourite flavour of js and ice cream.


The only 3rd party code I'm using is one [small polyfill](https://github.com/iamdustan/smoothscroll) because the boys over at Apple are [too uptight](https://caniuse.com/#search=scrollintoview) to allow parameter options for [`scrollIntoView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) in Safari. Oh and google analytics of course.

If you're using IE10, dont even bother. I have nothing to say to you
