# Personal website

I redesigned the site from scratch over a week in the summer of 2016. It has a much cleaner UI and is compatible with a greater number of browsers and devices.

In addition to this, I worked hard on improving the performance of my site. I converted some of the assets into svg images, and all the remaining png files were compressed using TinyPNG. By doing this, I circumvented the need to use something like the Lazy Load plugin to keep things simpler. Instead, I focused on optimising the functions I already have, and using external dependencies very selectively. I finally managed to get the intial page load size under 300kb.
