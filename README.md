# Personal website

I redesigned the site from scratch over a week in the summer of 2016. It has a much cleaner UI, is compatible with a greater number of browsers and is much quicker than before.

In addition to this, I worked hard on getting the page size very low. I managed to get the intial page load size comfortably under 500kb. I resized all my assets to have a much smaller footprint, while still retaining their original quality. Although I have a lot of resources that need to be loaded, I decided against using something like the Lazy Load plugin to keep things simpler. Instead, I focused on optimising the scripts I already have, and trimming external dependencies to only include the functions that I use.
