# Personal website

My goal when I began development was to keep the initial page size as small as possible <sup>[inspiration](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com)<sup> warning: colorful language</sup></sup>. After the first round of development, I reduced the size of all network calls from 1400kb to less than 200kb (including frequently cached resources like fonts and Google Analytics)

Update - July 2016
I rewrote all the scripts from scratch to remove the dependence on jQuery and jQuery UI. The site now uses native JS and CSS, only using the grid from Bootstrap

-------------------

Dependencies
-----
- Bootstrap - **Grid and responsive utilities only**, no js
- ~~jQuery~~
- ~~jQuery UI~~
- ~~Animate.css~~
- Google Maps Web API

After completing the first round of development, I will be rewriting parts of my code to be native and not be dependent on external libraries

-------------------

Testing
-----

The website was tested on and optimised for Safari and Google Chrome on both desktop and mobile devices.

There are some minor compatibility issues for the hero svg on Firefox and am working to fix them.
